The Smart Greenhouse Management System is an IoT-based solution designed to automate and optimize environmental conditions within a greenhouse to enhance plant growth and resource efficiency. The system utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller connected to various sensors, including temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light sensors, to monitor real-time conditions.

Based on sensor data, the system automatically controls actuators such as fans, water pumps, and lights to maintain optimal growing conditions. It is integrated with the Blynk platform, allowing users to remotely monitor and manage the greenhouse environment via a mobile app. The system also supports manual overrides, real-time alerts, and data logging for performance analysis.

Simulation and testing are carried out using Wokwi, ensuring functionality and robustness before physical deployment. Key challenges such as sensor calibration, wireless communication stability, and UI design are addressed through iterative testing and optimization.

Overall, this project demonstrates how smart technology can significantly improve agricultural practices by reducing manual intervention, conserving resources, and increasing crop yield through intelligent automation.
